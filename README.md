# JavaScript-Projects

Welcome to my **JavaScript-Projects** repository! This collection is a showcase of simple JavaScript examples and applications I've built for personal practice and to solidify my understanding of the language.

## üìù About The Repository

This repository serves as a learning log and portfolio for my journey with JavaScript. Each project is a self-contained example of a specific concept or functionality, ranging from basic DOM manipulation to more advanced API integrations. Feel free to explore!
