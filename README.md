# JavaScript-Projects

Welcome to my **JavaScript-Projects** repository! This collection is a showcase of simple JavaScript examples and applications I've built for personal practice and to solidify my understanding of the language.

## üìù About The Repository

This repository serves as a learning log and portfolio for my journey with JavaScript. Each project is a self-contained example of a specific concept or functionality, ranging from basic DOM manipulation to more advanced API integrations. Feel free to explore!

## üìÇ Projects

Each project resides in its own dedicated folder. Inside each folder, you will find:

* The project's source code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
* A dedicated `README.md` file with a detailed description, how to run the project, and a list of features.

**Example Project:** One of the projects you'll find here is a **TODO List**. This is a simple application where a user can add tasks. A unique feature is the integration with **Groq AI**, allowing users to get task descriptions or suggestions based on their input.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run any of the projects locally, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/PrajwalKarande/JavaScript-Projects.git](https://github.com/PrajwalKarande/JavaScript-Projects.git)
