# GenAI-TODO-List 📝🤖

A simple **JavaScript To-Do List application** with a twist — it integrates **Generative AI** to help you plan and organize tasks.  
You can add tasks manually like a regular to-do app, or you can describe your activities in plain language and let the AI generate a list of tasks for you.
